=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a command-line client for the L<Strava|http://strava.com/>
service.  Use C<strava> with no arguments for help.

This interface needs expanding! Submit issues with feature requests and
I will look at adding them, I currently don't have any use cases for
it.

=head1 SETUP

=head2 Installation

If you have not already installed this software, the easiest way
is to use L<cpanm> and L<local::lib>. If you don't have them installed,
it's easy with:

    curl -L http://cpanmin.us/ | perl - --self-upgrade
    ~/perl5/bin/cpanm -L ~/perl5 App::local::lib::helper
    source ~/perl5/bin/localenv-bashrc

You might want to put that last line in your F<~/.bashrc> file.

You can then install C<strava> and related utilities with:

    cpanm WebService::Strava3

=head2 API Registration

You will need to register for a Client Secret + Access token here:
https://www.strava.com/settings/api

Set the authorization callback domain to: http://127.0.0.1

=head2 Configuration

You will need the following

  client_id     = xxxxx
  client_secret = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

You can get these values by going to https://www.strava.com/settings/api
and registering your application. After registration simply run:

    strava setup
